## Who Are We? 

Our `Churn Insights` team, comprised of adept developers and data scientists, is driven by a shared passion for technology and data analytics. Our expertise in data analysis underpins our commitment to this project.

### Project Summary 

`Churn Insights` is an analytical platform dedicated to understanding and reducing customer attrition. Aimed at stakeholders such as business managers, data analysts, and customer relationship teams, it provides actionable insights through the careful analysis of customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind customer departures.

### Motivation and Purpose 

As a data analytics team, we strive to provide our target audience with a comprehensive tool that elucidates the various determinants of customer churn.

### The Challenge 

The business environment is intricate, often characterized by competitive market dynamics. There's a pronounced need for understanding customer behavior, especially to retain valuable customers and reduce churn rates.

### Dashboard Features 

With `Churn Insights`, you can explore customer trends, analyze attributes influencing churn, and view real-time churn predictions, all through an interactive and intuitive interface.

### The Solution 

Our `Churn Insights` dashboard is an empowering tool that enables:

-   The exploration of customer data with customizable features and filters.
-   Community-driven contributions to our database, fostering growth and inclusivity.
-   The synthesis of valuable insights to facilitate well-informed business decisions.

## What Are We Doing? 

### The Dashboard 

<img src="img/demo.gif" width="1000"/>

The current iteration of `Churn Insights` boasts:

-   Interactive filters for localized customer data analysis.
-   Correlative bar plots that elucidate the influence of customer features on churn.
-   An interactive map to visualize geographical data and churn distributions.
-   A table with an implemented churn probability slider for interactive filtering.

### Forward Vision 

We are poised to refine `Churn Insights` further, enhancing its interactivity and user interface. Our ambitions include the integration of advanced predictive analytics and the expansion of our dataset to encompass global markets.

## Project Building Steps

1.  **ETL Process in PostgreSQL from pgAdmin**
2.  **Data Cleaning in PostgreSQL**
3.  **Tableau Transformations**
4.  **Tableau Visualization & Enhancing Visuals**
5.  **Build Machine Learning Model** - EDA and build KNN, Decision tree, Random Forest, RBF SVM, Logistic regression models in Jupyter Notebook and finally pick the best model to predict and show the results.
